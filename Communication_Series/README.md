### Interface Classification
#### Simplex & Duplex(Full/ Half)
Simplex: Monodirectional 
Duplex(Full/ Half): Bidirectional(Simultaneously available or not)
#### Serial & Parallel
Serial: UART. Parallel: RAM/LCD.
#### Synchronous & Asynchronous
Synchronous: Both sender(Master) and receiver(Slave) share the same clock(SPI, L2C)
Asynchronous: Data sent without a clock(UART)
#### Communication
Point to point: between 2 devices(UART)
Multi_drop: Single transmitter and multiple receivers(SPI)
Multi_point: channel is shared between devices(L2C)

### UART(Universal Asynchronous Receiver & Transmitter)
baud rate measures the speed of data transmission, including start, stop, and parity bits. (number of bits/second)
bit rate(bps) indicates the amount of the actual data transmitted from the sender to the receiver.
#### TX
idle state: 1, start bit: 0, LSB, ..., MSB, stop bit:1, idle state

For example, in UART communication, the baud rate can be calculated using the following formula:
Baud rate = Clock frequency / Divisor
Suppose the clock frequency of a UART device is 16 MHz, and the desired baud rate is 9600 bps. To calculate the divisor, we can rearrange the formula:
Divisor = Clock frequency / Baud rate
Divisor = 16,000,000 Hz / 9600 bps â‰ˆ 1667
In this case, the divisor is approximately 1667. 
The divisor may be rounded to the nearest integer value to achieve the closest possible baud rate to the desired value.
