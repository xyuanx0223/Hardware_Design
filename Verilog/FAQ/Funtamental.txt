logical right shift (i.e >>) & arithmetic right shift (i.e >>>)
A )Logical Left and Arithmetic Left shift show no difference in the result.

B) Whereas if we consider the Right shift logical it adds zero at MSB while shifting the rest of the bit to the right resulting in minus the MSB

C) For unsigned data, This works pretty much perfectly but for Signed data if we declare reg signed [7:0] din; we lose the signed bit.
